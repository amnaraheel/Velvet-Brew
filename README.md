# Velvet Brew Cafe

## Project Overview:
Velvet Brew Cafe's website development project aimed to create an engaging and functional online presence for the cafe. The website includes essential pages such as Home, Menus, About Us, and Contact Us. Two crucial forms, the Booking Form and Contact Us Form, have been integrated and connected to a Firebase database. The project followed a Scrum methodology with project management conducted through Jira.

## Project Objectives:
1.	Develop an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website for Velvet Brew Cafe.
2.	Implement mobile responsiveness to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.
3.	Integrate Booking and Contact Us forms, with data stored securely in Firebase.
4.	Efficiently manage the development process using the Scrum framework and Jira.

## Development Process:

### 1. Sprint Planning:
The project was divided into sprints. Sprint planning sessions were conducted to define and prioritize tasks from the product backlog. Backlog items were broken down into user stories and tasks, with estimates assigned.

### 2. Sprint Execution:
During each sprint, the team worked collaboratively to complete the defined tasks. Daily stand-up meetings were held to discuss progress, challenges, and plan for the day. Development tasks included setting up pages (Home, Menus, About Us, Contact Us), creating forms, and ensuring mobile responsiveness.

### 3. Sprint Review:
At the end of each sprint, a sprint review was conducted to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders. Feedback from stakeholders was considered, and adjustments were made to the project plan accordingly.

### 4. Testing and QA:
A dedicated QA team conducted thorough testing of the website. This included functionality testing of forms, responsiveness across devices, and database interactions. Bugs and issues were documented and addressed promptly.

### 5. Deployment:
Once testing was successful, the website was deployed on the chosen hosting platform, Hosinger. Domain settings were configured, and the website was made publicly accessible.

### 6. Documentation:
Comprehensive documentation was created, covering the project setup, configurations, and any additional information for maintenance. This documentation will serve as a reference for future updates and enhancements.

## Results and Achievements:
•	Velvet Brew Cafe now has a visually appealing and functional website.
•	Users can easily navigate through Home, Menus, About Us, and Contact Us pages.
•	The Booking and Contact Us forms are seamlessly integrated and connected to a Firebase database.

## Conclusion:
The successful completion of the Velvet Brew Cafe website development project demonstrates effective collaboration, adherence to the Scrum framework, and the use of Jira for streamlined project management. The website meets the client's requirements for functionality, aesthetics, and seamless interaction with customers.

## Future Recommendations:
Ongoing maintenance and support are recommended to address any future updates, security enhancements, or additional features. Regular monitoring and analytics implementation can provide insights into user behavior and further improve the website's performance. Additionally, user feedback should be actively sought and considered for continuous improvement.
